      <summary><strong>SKY_L1 - Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs</strong></summary>
      
      **Notes:**
      
     All embedded boards contain processor chips. The black chip is actually a package, with the actual chip located inside this package. The package shown is a QFN (Quad Flat No-leads) 48 package. The actual chip pins are connected to the package pins using wire bonds.

      </p>      
       Upon   opening the real chip, we can see the pads that connect the pins to the outside. Any signal entering or exiting the chip does so through these pads. Then we have the core, which contains all the digital logic. The die comprises both the core and the pads together.
       Chip Internals : Inside the core, we have MACROS(SoC, GPIO Banks, SPIs) and Foundry IPs(like PLL, SDCs, DAC, SRAM)

      <summary><strong>SKY_L2 - Introduction to RISC-V</strong></summary>
     
      **Notes: -**
      RISC- V ISA can be described most abstractly as the language or computer or the way in which we talk to the computer.
      If we have a C program, and it needs to be run on a particular chip layout, the entire flow of processing can be represented as below:
     
      C Program ----> Assembly Language(RISC V) ---> Machine Language(Binary form) ----> The bits get executed on the chip layout
 
      Another interface that needs to be represented between RISC V and the layout is the Hardware Description Language. The particular RISC V specifications need to be described or implented using some RTL(example implementation of picorv32 cpu core shown in image). Then follows the RTL to layout or RTL to GDSII flow.

      <summary>SKY_L3 - From Software Applications to Hardware</strong></summary>
     
      **Notes :- **
      The Applications that we use in our computer is actually run on the chip hardware present inside. The applications (written in any language like java, c++) enters into a system software and the software converts the program/app into binary language form. The various levels/layers of systwm software in this flow is Operating System, Compiler and Assembler.
     Apart from the other jobs of OS( like Handling IO operations, Allocatiing memory etc), the majot job of OS is to compile and convert to assembly language and finally to binary form to be understood by the machine.
